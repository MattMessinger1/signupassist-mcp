# SignupAssist MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for automated signup assistance across multiple platforms including SkiClubPro/Blackhawk, DaySmart, and CampMinder.

## Architecture

```
/mcp_server/        â†’ Registers all MCP tools with the framework
/providers/
  /skiclubpro/      â†’ Tools for Blackhawk signup (login, register, pay)
  /daysmart/        â†’ Tools for DaySmart signup (to be added later)
  /campminder/      â†’ Tools for CampMinder signup
/core/
  /scheduler/       â†’ Cron/worker logic to trigger signups at exact open times
  /billing/         â†’ Stripe integration + success-flag logic (we only get paid if signup succeeds)
  /auth/           â†’ Credential handling and encryption
/evals/             â†’ Evaluation scripts and metrics (Coverage, Win Rate, Credential Reuse, Billing alignment)
```
